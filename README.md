Experimental physics investigation into the cross-section of an aluminium target using a radioactive photon source

We conducted basic research into the subject of cross-sections, and
specifically the cross-section of aluminium. A cross-section can be thought of as a
measure of probability that a given physical phenomenon will occur as a consequence
of the collision of photons ($\gamma$-particles) with matter particles in the target, which is
determines how large the transverse area to the incident particles must be in order for a
certain proportion of the photons to scatter. We discuss the results of the
experiment using radioactive Ba-133 as the source of these photons.
